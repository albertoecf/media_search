        New endpoint to our Flask application 
Allows users to retrieve a random image from Unsplash based on a search query. 
The endpoint makes a GET request to the Unsplash API with the query and the UNPLASH_KEY
    as parameters and returns the "download" URL of the image in response. 
To test the new functionality, the user must activate their Python environment and run the main.py file.

Steps : 
- Created a .env.local file to store the Unsplash API key securely.
- Installed the Python library 'dotenv' using pip.
- Imported the dotenv library in your main.py file and loaded the .env.local file using the 'load_dotenv()' function.
- Used the 'os' library to access the API key stored in the .env.local file.
- Created a Flask app with a route 'new-image' that retrieves a random image from the Unsplash API based on a search query 'word' passed as a parameter in the URL.
- Used the 'requests' library to make a GET request to the Unsplash API and retrieve the data.
- Returned the download URL of the image as the response to the route.
